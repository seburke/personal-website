        <p>This project was completed to satisfy MIT's <a class="text-link" href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/91450">Thesis</a> requirement for a Masters of Engineering degree.
            The goal of my thesis was to develop an algorithm that could make small adjustments to a robot's planned trajectory in real time when dealing with unstructured dynamic environments.
            When in a dynamic environment, such as working with humans, a robot's planned path may become invalid due to a collision.
            A robot may need to generate several new paths to complete one task which may be infeasible due to time constraints. The reactive trajectory adjustment algorithm solves this problem by making small
            adjustments to the original path (if possible), which will be much faster than always generating new paths.

                <p><strong>Pole Collision Adjustment:</strong> This video shows the WAM robot simulated in OpenRAVE. The original trajectory shows the robot colliding with a pole-like object.
                The robot uses the reactive trajectory adjustment algorithm to avoid the collision with the new trajectory.</p> <!-- style this. -->

                <p><strong>Goal Adjustment:</strong> This video shows the WAM robot simulated in OpenRAVE. In this scenario the robot is tracking an individual cup until it goes out of range,
                and then selects a new cup to track. This shows another use of the reactive trajectory adjustment algorithm rather than just collision adjustment.</p> <!-- style this. -->
